        <p>
          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
          named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up
          late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
          Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
          with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
          could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
          repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
          speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing,
          but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJYc9YmKIO8&amp;feature=youtu.be">the first sliver of cosmic time</a>
          with telescopes at the South Pole,
          a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
          Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
          space-time — so-called <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
          universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
          trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
          Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
          though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
          science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the
          universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
          realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
          extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
          cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
          beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
          universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
          pasta water boiling over.
        </p>
        <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
        <p>
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
          Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation
          of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
          general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said,
          “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral
          patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
          space and preserves a picture of the universe when it
           was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators,
          working in an experiment known as Bicep, for
          Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
          Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers
          submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was
          only one in 10 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he
          had not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
          worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a
          leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
          meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology
          (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979),
          in his office last week.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
          scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
          tended his radio telescopes.
        </p>

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
          the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation,
          in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
          Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlfIVEy_YOA">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a>
          to tell him the news.
